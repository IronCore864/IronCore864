      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I like sports. I used to train a lot in the gym, do Olympic distance triathlons and some road bike and mountain bike races, even finished one full marathon. Now I like riding mountain bikes and hiking in summer and skilling/snowboarding in winter. I do bike parks as well with my Canyon Spectral trail bike.</p>
      <p>I like driving, both cars and motorcycle. I enjoy grand tours very much. In 2016 I did some tours in the Baltic countries, in 2017 I traveled across whole Italy, and Sweden, in 2018 I did a 9000 km tour all the way to north cape then back to Munich. 2019 I did a 5500 km tour from Munich to Scotland. And I’ve already been to the Nürburgring with my own car. I’m currently driving a BMW M2 Competition and I enjoy it a lot; sold my BMW S1000RR 2017 for a BMW C400X for easier city commute.</p>
